  <section class="main-section" id="API_Reference">
    <header>API Reference</header>
    <p>The Stripe API is organized around
      <a href="">REST</a>.
      Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts <a href="">form-encoded</a>
      request bodies, returns <a href="">JSON-encoded</a>
       responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.</p>
    <p>You can use the Stripe API in test mode, which does not affect your live data or interact with the banking networks. The API key you use to
      <a href="">authenticate</a>
       the request determines whether the request is live mode or test mode.</p>
    <p>The Stripe API differs for every account as we release new
      <a href="">versions</a> and tailor functionality. <span>
        Log in to see docs customized to your version of the API, with your test key and data.</span></p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Authentication">
    <header>Authentication</header>
    <p>The Stripe API uses <a href="">API keys</a> to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in <a href="">the Stripe Dashboard</a>.</p>
    <p>Test mode secret keys have the prefix <code>sk_test_</code> and live mode secret keys have the prefix <code>sk_live_</code>. Alternatively, you can use <a href="">restricted API keys</a> for granular permissions.</p>
    <p>Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.</p>
    <p>Authentication to the API is performed via <a href="">HTTP Basic Auth</a>. Provide your API key as the basic auth username value. You do not need to provide a password.</p>
    <p>If you need to authenticate via bearer auth (e.g., for a cross-origin request), use <code>-H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc"</code> instead of <code>-u sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc</code>.</p>
    <p>All API requests must be made over <a href="">HTTPS</a>. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Connected_Accounts">
    <header>Connected Accounts</header>
<p>Clients can make requests as connected accounts using the special header <code>Stripe-Account</code> which should contain a Stripe account ID (usually starting with the prefix <code>acct_</code>).</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Errors">
    <header>Errors</header>
    <p>Stripe uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the <code>2xx</code> range indicate success. Codes in the <code>4xx</code> range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the <code>5xx</code> range indicate an error with Stripe's servers (these are rare).</p>
    <p>Some <code>4xx</code> errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g., a card is <a href="">declined</a>) include an <a href="">error code</a> that briefly explains the error reported.</p>
      <h2>Error Types</h2>
        <code>api_error</code>
        <ul><li>API errors cover any other type of problem (e.g., a temporary
                problem with Stripe's servers), and are extremely
                uncommon.</li></ul>

        <code>card_error</code>
        <ul><li>Card errors are the most common type of error you should
          expect to handle.</li><li>They result when the user enters a card that
          can't be charged for some reason.</li></ul>

        <code>idempotency_error</code>
        <ul><li>Idempotency errors occur when an <code>Idempotency-Key</code>
            is re-used on a request that does not match the first request's
            API endpoint and parameters.</li></ul>

        <code>invalid_request_error</code>
        <ul><li>Invalid request errors arise when your request has invalid
            parameters.</li></ul>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Expanding_Responses">
    <header>Expanding Responses</header>
    <p>Many objects allow you to request additional information as an expanded response by using the <code>expand</code> request parameter. This parameter is available on all API requests, and applies to the response of that request only. Responses can be expanded in two ways.</p>
    <p>In many cases, an object contains the ID of a related object in its response properties. For example, a <code>Charge</code> may have an associated <code>Customer</code> ID. Those objects can be expanded inline with the <code>expand</code> request parameter. ID fields that can be expanded into objects are noted in this documentation with the<code>expandable</code> label.</p>
    <p>In some cases, such as the Issuing Card object's <code>number</code> and <code>cvc</code> fields, there are available fields that are not included in responses by default. You can request these fields as an expanded response by using the <code>expand</code> request parameter. Fields that can be included in an expanded response are noted in this documentation with the <code>expandable</code> label.</p>
    <p>You can expand recursively by specifying nested fields after a dot (<code>.</code>). For example, requesting <code>invoice.subscription</code> on a charge will expand the <code>invoice</code> property into a full Invoice object, and will then expand the <code>subscription</code> property on that invoice into a full Subscription object.</p>
    <p>You can use the <code>expand</code> param on any endpoint which returns expandable fields, including list, create, and update endpoints.</p>
    <p>Expansions on list requests start with the <code>data</code> property. For example, you would expand <code>data.customers</code> on a request to list charges and associated customers. Many deep expansions on list requests can be slow.</p>
    <p>Expansions have a maximum depth of four levels (so for example, when listing charges,<code>data.invoice.subscription.default_source</code> is the deepest allowed).</p>
    <p>You can expand multiple objects at once by identifying multiple items in the <code>expand</code> array.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Idempotent_Requests">
    <header>Idempotent Requests</header>
    <p>The API supports <a href="">idempotency</a> for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. This is useful when an API call is disrupted in transit and you do not receive a response. For example, if a request to <a href="">create a charge</a> does not respond due to a network connection error, you can retry the request with the same idempotency key to guarantee that no more than one charge is created.</p>
    <p>To perform an idempotent request, provide an additional <code>Idempotency-Key: &lt;key&gt;</code> header to the request.</p>
    <p>Stripe's idempotency works by saving the resulting status code and body of the first request made for any given idempotency key, regardless of whether it succeeded or failed. Subsequent requests with the same key return the same result, including <code>500</code> errors.</p>
    <p>An idempotency key is a unique value generated by the client which the server uses to recognize subsequent retries of the same request. How you create unique keys is up to you, but we suggest using V4 UUIDs, or another random string with enough entropy to avoid collisions. Idempotency keys can be up to 255 characters long.</p>
    <p>Keys are eligible to be removed from the system automatically after they're at least 24 hours old, and a new request is generated if a key is reused after the original has been pruned. The idempotency layer compares incoming parameters to those of the original request and errors unless they're the same to prevent accidental misuse.</p>
    <p>Results are only saved if an API endpoint started executing. If incoming parameters failed validation, or the request conflicted with another that was executing concurrently, no idempotent result is saved because no API endpoint began execution. It is safe to retry these requests.</p>
    <p>All <code>POST</code> requests accept idempotency keys. Sending idempotency keys in <code>GET</code> and <code>DELETE</code> requests has no effect and should be avoided, as these requests are idempotent by definition.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Metadata">
  <header>Metadata</header>
    <p>Updateable Stripe objects—including <a href="">Account</a>, <a href="">Charge</a>, <a href="">Customer</a>, <a href="">PaymentIntent</a>, <a href="">Refund</a>, <a href="">Subscription</a>, and <a href="">Transfer</a>—have a <code>metadata</code> parameter. You can use this parameter to attach key-value data to these Stripe objects.</p>
    <p>You can specify up to 50 keys, with key names up to 40 characters long and values up to 500 characters long.</p>
    <p>Metadata is useful for storing additional, structured information on an object. As an example, you could store your user's full name and corresponding unique identifier from your system on a Stripe <a href="">Customer</a> object. Metadata is not used by Stripe—for example, not used to authorize or decline a charge—and won't be seen by your users unless you choose to show it to them.</p>
    <p>Some of the objects listed above also support a <code>description</code> parameter. You can use the <code>description</code> parameter to annotate a charge—with, for example, a human-readable description like <code>2 shirts for test@example.com</code>. Unlike <code>metadata</code>, <code>description</code> is a single string, and your users may see it (e.g., in email receipts Stripe sends on your behalf).</p>
    <p>Do not store any sensitive information (bank account numbers, card details, etc.) as metadata or in the <code>description</code> parameter.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Pagination">
    <header>Pagination</header>
    <p>All top-level API resources have support for bulk fetches via "list" API methods. For instance, you can <a href="">list charges</a>, <a href="">list customers</a>, and <a href="">list invoices</a>. These list API methods share a common structure, taking at least these three parameters: <code>limit</code>, <code>starting_after</code>, and <code>ending_before</code>.</p>
    <p>Stripe utilizes cursor-based pagination via the <code>starting_after</code> and <code>ending_before</code> parameters. Both parameters take an existing object ID value (see below) and return objects in reverse chronological order. The <code>ending_before</code> parameter returns objects listed before the named object. The <code>starting_after</code> parameter returns objects listed after the named object. These parameters are mutually exclusive -- only one of <code>starting_after</code> or<code>ending_before</code> may be used.</p>
    <p>Our client libraries offer <a href="">auto-pagination</a> helpers to easily traverse all pages of a list.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Request_IDs">
    <header>Request IDs</header>
    <p>Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under <code>Request-Id</code>. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your <a href="">Dashboard</a>. <strong>If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.</strong></p>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Versioning">
    <header>Versioning</header>
<p>When <a href="">backwards-incompatible</a> changes are made to the API, a new, dated version is released. <span>The current version is <strong>2020-08-27</strong>.</span> Read our <a href="/docs/upgrades">API upgrades guide</a> to see our <a href="">API changelog</a> and to learn more about backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>All requests use your account API settings, unless you override the API version. The <a href=""> changelog</a> lists every available version. <em>Note that by default webhook events are structured according to your account API version, unless you set an API version during <a href="">endpoint creation</a>.</em></p>
<p>To set the API version on a specific request, send a <code>Stripe-Version</code> header.</p>
<p>You can visit <a href="">your Dashboard</a> to upgrade your API version. As a precaution, use API versioning to test a new API version before committing to an upgrade.</p>
